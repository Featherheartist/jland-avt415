        <h2>Cuttlefish</h2>
        <p>I love cuttlefish, they're very fascinating creatures! What I would want to make a simple "marine fun fact" type of webpage. Something you'd see at an aquarium. Could be pages/sections based on where they are in the world, their impact on the ecosystem, etc. Would want to use lots of infographics.</p>

        <h2>More animal pages (about, zoo style, etc)</h2>
        <p>Similar to the cuttlefish idea, I could do a webpage on different animals focusing on infographics and more. </p>

        <h2>Plantcare</h2>
        <p>Focusing on a single type of plant, you'll go through the steps on how to take care, water, repot, and upkeep a certain species of plant.</p>
