    <h1>3 Company Ideas</h1>

    <main>
        <h2>Sticks and Stones (Taxidermy and Oddities shop)</h2>
        <p><b>Favorite Idea:</b> I feel that making a very modern oddities and taxidermy online store would be such a fun and unique idea! Would be a "glamorous spooky" aesthetic, very similar to how my mom decorates for halloween with lots of silver, blacks, and accent colors.</p>

        <h2>Small artist sticker and print shop</h2>
        <p>A webstore for a small artist who is selling stickers and prints. I could use my own art for examples, and it would be a good practice for designing the layout of my own personal webpage. Would be more of a cutesy idea, with adorable and simple sticker designs and lots of pastel colors.</p>

        <h2>Designer art toy shop</h2>
        <p>A modern and very "pop art" style webpage focusing on selling designer art toys by different artists. I could use artworks by Konatsuya and other artists who make animal style art toys for product examples. (For examples on what I mean, sites like myplasticheart.com and kidrobot are what designer art toy sites are like. I love the negora series, they're cool little funky kaiju cats.)</p>
